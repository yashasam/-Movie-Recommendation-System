# -Movie-Recommendation-System
This project is an end-to-end movie recommendation system built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The system suggests movies that are similar to a user-provided movie title based on content-based filtering using textual metadata like genres, keywords, cast, crew, and movie overviews.
